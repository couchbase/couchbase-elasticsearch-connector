:description: Elasticsearch Connector release notes

== Standalone Connector vs. Plug-in

Starting with version 4.0, the connector is now a standalone process.
The standalone distribution archives are named `couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-`.

Prior to version 4.0, the connector was implemented as an Elasticsearch plug-in.
The plug-in distributions have archive names starting with `elasticsearch-transport-couchbase-`.

[#version-compatibility]
=== Plug-in Version Compatibility

The https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/releases[GitHub releases] page lists all the plug-in variants.
In a given release, the plug-in's filename is of the form *+elasticsearch-transport-couchbase-${PLUGIN_VERSION}-alder-es${ES_VERSION}.zip+*.
It is imperative to use the file where *ES_VERSION* matches your Elasticsearch cluster version.
For example, to use the 3.0.0 version of the plug-in with Elasticsearch 5.6.4, you will need to download *elasticsearch-transport-couchbase-3.0.0-cypress-es5.6.4.zip*.

== Elasticsearch Connector 4.0.0-dp.1

https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/releases/tag/4.0.0-dp.1[Download]

=== New in the Developer Preview

* Compatible with Elasticsearch versions 5 and 6.

* Support for secure connections to Couchbase and Elasticsearch.

* Tools for managing replication checkpoints.

* A "rejection log" for documents Elasticsearch permanently refuses to index.

* Configurable document structure (omit metadata if you don't need it).

* The connector is a separate process instead of an Elasticsearch plug-in.

==== Things to be aware of

* Parent-child relationships are no longer supported, as this feature
was removed in ES 6.

* Custom document routing is not implemented. Please let us know
if this feature is still relevant for your deployment.

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 3.0.2

Maintenance release for improved compatibility and stability.

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-82[CBES-82]: NoClassDefFoundError under Java 9.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-83[CBES-83]: VersionConflictEngineException in storeUUID if document already exists.
(Causes XDCR replication to be removed.)

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 3.0.1

The `birch` development line has been retired.
The `cypress` line now supports all 5.x versions of Elasticsearch.

`RegexParentSelector` now reads the parent ID format from the correct config property (`couchbase.parentSelector.documentTypesParentFormat.<type>`).
If you previously put the parent ID format in the `documentTypeParentFields` property as a workaround, please update your configuration.

The connector can now delete child documents and other documents that have custom routing.
If you're using `RegexParentSelector` then this feature has no additional overhead.
Otherwise, for each document whose routing cannot be derived from the document ID, the connector creates a separate signpost document to record the routing.
Be aware that child documents created by previous versions of the connector are not eligible for deletion, since they don't have signposts (you'll see "missing signpost" warnings in the log when the connector tries to delete those documents).

The signposts have a document type of `couchbaseSignpost`.
The mapping for this type must store the contents of the `meta` field.
This is already the case if you're using the default mapping template included in the plug-in distribution.

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-49[CBES-49]: RegexParentSelector reads parent ID format from wrong config property.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-50[CBES-50]: RoutingMissingException when deleting child documents.

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 3.0.0

With https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/releases/tag/3.0.0-cypress[this release], the Couchbase plug-in for Elasticsearch moves to a new versioning and branch management strategy that allows for simultaneous releases across ES versions (see <<Version Compatibility>>).
All the versions are expected to work and are supported.
However, versions which have received more testing and are *officially* supported are:

* 3.0.0-cypress-es5.6.4
* 3.0.0-birch-es5.2.2
* 3.0.0-alder-es2.4.0

Don't be alarmed by the major version bump; upgrading from version 2.x of the plug-in should be seamless, and is recommended for all users.
The code has just been relabeled for easier maintenance.

=== New Feature

* Adds the `couchbase.pipeline` config for specifying the ingestion pipeline.

=== Enhancements

* Improves logging for indexing errors.
* Uses Dropwizard Metrics to collect and log richer stats.

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-48[CBES-48]: Connection counter leak could cause spurious `TooManyConcurrentConnections` errors.
* https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/issues/153[#153]: ClassCastException error when the TTL is of type `Long` instead of `Integer`.

=== Known issues

The Elasticsearch Plug-in does not support IPv6.
So to use the plug-in, the Couchbase Server and Elasticsearch clusters will need to run on instances which are addressable with IPv4.

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 2.2

This release note applies to the 2.2 version of the Elasticsearch Transport Plug-in (February 2017).
It adds a number of bug fixes.
See xref:getting-started.adoc[Installation and Configuration] for versioning and compatibility information.

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 2.1.1

This release note applies to the 2.1.1 version of the Elasticsearch Transport Plug-in (September 2015).
It adds compatibility with newer Elasticsearch versions up to 1.7.x, multiple new features, and quite a few bug fixes, including several that solve issues found in 2.1.0.
In particular, this release fixes a long-standing bug with an incorrect concurrent bulk request counter, which could eventually cause the plug-in to stop accepting requests from Couchbase Server altogether.

Some configuration option-names changed.
