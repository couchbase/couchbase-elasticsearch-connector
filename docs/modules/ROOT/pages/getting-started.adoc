:description: Learn how to install the Elasticsearch plug-in, and configure it between a Couchbase Server and Elasticsearch cluster.

A Couchbase-Elasticsearch data-replication system consists of three principal components:

* a *Couchbase Server cluster* of one or more nodes
* an *Elasticsearch cluster* of one or more nodes
* the *Elasticsearch Transport Plug-in*, installed in the Elasticsearch environment.

This section provides step-by-step instructions to install the Couchbase Elasticsearch plug-in.

[#prerequisites]
== Plug-in prerequisites

* Java (see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/[installation guide])
* Download and install Elasticsearch \<= 5.x (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/install-elasticsearch.html[installation guide], Elasticsearch 6.0 is not supported by the plug-in)
* Download and install Couchbase Server >= 3.0 (see https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[installation guide])

Verify the Elasticsearch cluster is up and running (the default port is `9200`).

[source,console]
----
$ curl localhost:9200

{
  "name" : "K3RqW4F",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "Bw-Ta0wDTcekzQIhXZHGkg",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "5.6.5",
    "build_hash" : "6a37571",
    "build_date" : "2017-12-04T07:50:10.466Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "6.6.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
----

Verify that Couchbase Server is running.

[source,console]
----
$ curl localhost:8092

{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"v4.5.1-60-g3cf258d","couchbase":"5.0.2-5506-community"}
----

[#installation]
== Installation

Navigate to the Elasticsearch installation directory.

[source,console]
----
$ cd /usr/share/elasticsearch
----

Download and install the plug-in package.

[source,console]
----
$ bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/releases/download/3.0.0-cypress/elasticsearch-transport-couchbase-3.0.0-cypress-es5.6.4.zip
----

Replace the plug-in URL with the one that matches your Elasticsearch version;
all URLs can be found on the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/releases[releases page].

NOTE: If you're using Elasticsearch 2.x, the command to install plug-ins is `bin/plugin` instead of `bin/elastichsearch-plugin`.

When the installation is successful, the message "`Installed transport-couchbase into /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/transport/couchbase`" will be logged.

[#configuration]
== Configuration

Open the Elasticsearch configuration file ([.path]_/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml_) and add the following to the end of the file.

[source,yaml]
----
couchbase.username: <USERNAME>
couchbase.password: <PASSWORD>
couchbase.maxConcurrentRequests: 1024
----

The *username* and *password* credentials will be used again later when configuring Couchbase Server.

Still in the [.path]_/usr/share/elasticsearch_ directory, configure the Elasticsearch plug-in with the following curl command.

[source,console]
----
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/_template/couchbase -d @plugins/transport-couchbase/couchbase_template.json
----

When successful, the configuration-routine provides the following response: `{"acknowledged":true}`.

Create an Elasticsearch index to receive the data from the Couchbase bucket.
Later, when configuring XDCR, the "remote bucket name" should match the Elasticsearch *index name*.

----
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/travel-sample

{"acknowledged":true}
----

Now to configure Couchbase Server, open the Couchbase Web Console and select menu:XDCR[Add Remote Cluster].

image::xdcrInitial.png[]

In the dialog, enter the *Cluster Name* of your choice, the *IP/hostname* and port number where the Elasticsearch cluster is running (the Elasticsearch plug-in listens on port 9091 by default) and the *Username/Password* previously stored in [.path]_elasticsearch.yml_.

image::remotecluster.png[]

Next, select the *Add Replication* option.

image::addreplication.png[]

On the pop-up window, enter the origin bucket, the remote cluster, and remote bucket (in this case it's the index that was created earlier).
Also make sure that the *XDCR Protocol* version is set to 1 and that the *XDCR Optimistic Replication Threshold* is set to the maximum value of *20971520* for optimal performance.
Then click btn:[Save].

Now that the replication is up and running, you can run full-text search queries on the Elasticsearch node.

----
$ curl localhost:9200/travel-sample/_search?q=san+francisco

{
    "took":5,
    "timed_out":false,
    "_shards":{"total":5,"successful":5,"skipped":0,"failed":0},
    "hits":{
        "total":1599,
        "max_score":11.965878,
        "hits":[
            {"_index":"travel-sample","_type":"couchbaseDocument","_id":"landmark_36047","_score":11.965878,"_source":{"meta":{"rev":"1-1508c18bdbb400000000000002000000","flags":33554432,"expiration":0,"id":"landmark_36047"}}},
            {"_index":"travel-sample","_type":"couchbaseDocument","_id":"landmark_25611","_score":11.905596,"_source":{"meta":{"rev":"1-1508c18bb43400000000000002000000","flags":33554432,"expiration":0,"id":"landmark_25611"}}},
            {"_index":"travel-sample","_type":"couchbaseDocument","_id":"landmark_25712","_score":11.905596,"_source":{"meta":{"rev":"1-1508c18bb61e00000000000002000000","flags":33554432,"expiration":0,"id":"landmark_25712"}}}
            ...
        ]
    }
}
----

Let's take a moment to discuss some properties in the response object:

* The `took` parameter indicates the number of milliseconds required for the search;
while fields within the `_shards` object indicate how many Elasticsearch shards were available for search, how many were accessed successfully, and how many unsuccessfully.
* The `total` field indicates the total number of items.
A `max_score` is provided, to indicate Elasticsearch’s estimate of the relevance of each search-hit.
Note that the source object contains only metadata, rather than a document’s entire contents: this is because the contents, if and when required, can more rapidly be retrieved from Couchbase itself;
using the document ID that is the value of the `_id` field.

[#deployment-considerations]
== Deployment Considerations

If you are working with an ElasticSearch cluster, it is recommended that you install the ElasticSearch Transport Plug-in on every node.
At minimum, you can install it on a single node.
The plug-in checks which nodes it's installed on and reports the public host addresses of those back to Couchbase.
XDCR is then directed to every node where the plug-in is installed.

Optionally, if your ElasticSearch cluster has https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-node.html[separate data and client nodes^], you can elect to install the ElasticSearch Transport Plug-in on just one set of nodes.
By installing on the data nodes only, you can reduce the amount of routing that needs to be done.
Alternatively, installing the plug-in on only the client nodes will offload CPU from the data nodes.
