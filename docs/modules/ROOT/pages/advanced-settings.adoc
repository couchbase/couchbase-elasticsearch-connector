= Advanced Settings

[abstract]
You can configure the Elasticsearch Transport Plug-in by means of settings in the file `config/elasticsearch.yml`.
This section provides a comprehensive list of the available options.
It also explains how to establish appropriate Java security-policy permissions, which are required for interoperation with Elasticsearch 2.1.x.

== Plug-in Settings and their Significance

The following settings are available for the Elasticsearch Transport Plug-in:

* *couchbase.port*: The port on which the plug-in listens.
The default is `9091`.
* *couchbase.username*: The username for authentication over basic HTTP.
The default is `Administrator`.
* *couchbase.password*: The password for authentication over basic HTTP.
There is no default.
* *couchbase.num_vbuckets*: The number of vbuckets that Elasticsearch should index.
On Mac, the default is `64`; on all other platforms, `1024`.
This value must match the number of vbuckets on the Couchbase cluster.
* *couchbase.maxConcurrentRequests*: The number of concurrent requests allowed by the plug-in.
The default is `1024`.
This number can be lowered to reduce machine-load.
* *couchbase.bulkIndexRetries*: The number of retries permitted on non-fatal bulk-indexing errors.
The default is `10`.
* *couchbase.bulkIndexRetryWaitMs*: The number of milliseconds permitted to elapse between bulk-index retries.
The default is `1000`.
* *couchbase.ignoreFailures*: A value of `true` causes the plug-in to return a success-status to Couchbase Server, even if some documents could not be indexed.
This prevents XDCR from stalling due to Elasticsearch indexing errors (for example, when a schema-change breaks some of the Elasticsearch type-mappings).
The default is `false`.
* *couchbase.ignoreDeletes*: Accepts as a value a list of one or more index-names, specified as a comma- or semicolon-delimited string.
The plug-in ignores document-deletion and expiration for each named index.
(This allows information to be indefinitely archived; and may therefore lead to significant growth in index-size.)
* *couchbase.wrapCounters*: A value of `true` causes the plug-in to store all integer-values provided by Couchbase that are not valid JSON documents in a document whose format is `{＂value＂:<value>}`, and is stored under the Couchbase Server ID originally specified for the value.
The default is `false`.
* *couchbase.ignoreDotIndexes*: A value of `true` causes the plug-in to ignore indexes and aliases whose names have a period as their initial character: for `example`, `.kibana`, `.marvel`, `.clover`.
The default is `true`.
* *couchbase.includeIndexes*: Accepts as a value a list of one or more index-names, specified as a comma- or semicolon-delimited string.
The plug-in ignores all indexes not included in the list.
This prohibits creation of additional indexes for the storing of checkpoint metadata (potentially unnecessary, when the number of replicated indexes is small).
Note that this setting takes precedence over *ignoreDotIndexes*, and therefore forces use of indexes whose names have a period as their initial character, even if their use has been explicitly prohibited by *ignoreDotIndexes* (see immediately above).
* *couchbase.typeSelector*: Specifies the type selector class to be used for mapping documents to types.
The following options are available:
 ** `org.elasticsearch.transport.couchbase.capi.DefaultTypeSelector`: Maps all documents to the specified type (see immediately below).
This is the default type selector, and so need not be explicitly specified.
Type-specification is managed by the following settings:
  *** *couchbase.typeSelector.defaultDocumentType*: The document type to which the `DefaultTypeSelector` maps all documents.
The default is `couchbaseDocument`.
  *** *couchbase.typeSelector.checkpointDocumentType*: The document type to which replication-checkpoint documents are mapped.
The default is `couchbaseCheckpoint`.
 ** `org.elasticsearch.transport.couchbase.capi.DelimiterTypeSelector`: If the document ID is in the format `<`_type_`><`_delimiter_`><*>`, documents are mapped to the type specified by `<`_type_`>`.
Otherwise, the `DefaultTypeSelector` is used: note that this entails use of the default delimiter, which is the colon character (`:`); and in consequence, a document with the ID `user:123` is indexed under the type `user`.
The delimiter can be set to a different character, by means of the following setting:
  *** *couchbase.typeSelector.documentTypeDelimiter*: Specifies the delimiter to be used for the `DelimiterTypeSelector`.
The default is the colon character (`:`).
 ** `org.elasticsearch.transport.couchbase.capi.GroupRegexTypeSelector`: Maps documents that match the specified regular expression with a capture group named _type_ (see immediately below).
If the document does not match, or if no capture group named _type_ has been defined, the `DefaultTypeSelector` is used instead.
  *** *couchbase.typeSelector.documentTypesRegex*: Specifies the regular expression to be used for mapping Couchbase document IDs to Elasticsearch types.
For example, the expression `^(?<type>\w+::.+$` maps document IDs of the format `<type>::<stuff>` to the type `<type>`; so that the ID `user:123` is indexed under the type `user`.
 ** `org.elasticsearch.transport.couchbase.capi.RegexTypeSelector`: Maps document IDs that match the specified regular expressions to named types.
If an ID does not match any specified expression, `DefaultTypeSelector` is used to select the type.
  *** *couchbase.typeSelector.documentTypesRegex.**: Specifies a regular expression with a named type.
For example, `couchbase.typeSelector.documentTypesRegex.users: ^user-.+$` maps all document IDs that start with the string `user-` to the type `users`.
* *couchbase.parentSelector*: The parent-selector class to be used for mapping child-documents to parents.
(This facility is provided since, due to the nature of XDCR, a child document may be replicated before the parent, leading to unpredictable behavior on the Elasticsearch side.) The value of this setting can be one of the following:
 ** `org.elasticsearch.transport.couchbase.capi.DefaultParentSelector`: Maps documents to parents according to a predefined map of types to field-names.
This is specified as follows:
  *** *couchbase.parentSelector.documentTypeParentFields.**: Specifies which document-field contains the ID of the parent-document for a specified type.
For example, `couchbase.parentSelector.documenttypeParentFields.order: doc.user_id` sets the parent ID of all documents whose type is `order` to the value of the `user_id` field.
 ** `org.elasticsearch.transport.couchbase.capi.RegexParentSelector`: Maps documents to parents, acording to a specified regular expression, using the capture group `parent`.
The format of the parent document-ID can be user-determined.
The value for this setting can be established as follows:
  *** *couchbase.parentSelector.documentTypesParentRegex.**: Specifies a named regular expression for matching the parent document-ID.
For example, `couchbase.documentTypesParentRegex.typeA: ^typeA::(?<parent>.+)` with the document-ID `typeA::123` uses `123` as the parent document-ID.
  *** *couchbase.parentSelector.documentTypesParentFormat.**: Specifies an optional format for the parent document-ID that is matched by the regular expression described immediately above.
Uses `<parent>` as the placeholder for the matched ID.
For example, `couchbase.documentTypesParentFormat.typeA: parentType::<parent>`, used with the previous example, produces the parent document-ID `parentType::123`.
* *couchbase.documentTypeRoutingFields.**: A mapping of types to custom document routing-paths.
For example, specifying `couchbase.documentTypeRoutingFields.users: user_id` uses the field `user_id` as the custom routing-path for type `users`.
* *couchbase.keyFilter*: Specifies the document filter-class to be used for filtering documents on the Elasticseach plug-in side.
Note that Couchbase sends all documents through XDCR: the document-filter determines whether specific documents be indexed or ignored, according to their ID.
The value for this setting can be one of the following:
 ** `org.elasticsearch.transport.couchbase.capi.DefaultKeyFilter`: Allows all documents through.
This is the default setting, and therefore does not need to be specified.
 ** `org.elasticsearch.transport.couchbase.capi.RegexKeyFilter`: Allows documents through, or disallows, based on a regular expression that is specified by means of the following settings:
  *** *couchbase.keyFilter.type*: Specifies whether the filter includes or excludes the matched documents.
Value can be either `include` or `exclude`.
If include, only documents with IDs that match one of the regular expressions are indexed.
If exclude, only documents that _do not match any_ of the regular expressions are indexed.
  *** *couchbase.keyFilter.keyFiltersRegex.**: Specifies one or more regular expressions to be matched against the document ID, before indexing occurs in Elasticsearch.
For example, `couchbase.keyFilter.type: exclude + couchbase.keyFilter.keyFiltersRegex.temp: ^temp.*$` causes the plug-in to ignore each document whose ID commences with `temp`.

== Java Security-Policy Permissions

The Elasticsearch Transport Plug-in works with Elasticsearch 2.1.x only if the system’s default `java.policy` file is appropriately edited.
The file is located in the directory `%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security`.
The file can be edited either directly, or by means of the `policytool` utility, located in the directory `%JAVA_HOME%/bin`.
Note that for either procedure, root permissions are required.

[.ui]*Edit Directly*

If editing the policy directly, add the following to the end of the file:

----
grant codeBase "file:/<path to transport-couchbase plug-in install directory>/*" {
    permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "modifyPrincipals";
    permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "modifyPrivateCredentials";
    permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "setReadOnly";
    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "setContextClassLoader";
    permission java.net.SocketPermission "*", "listen,resolve";
    permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";
};
----

Include, as indicated above, the appropriate path for the directory where the plug-in was installed.
For example, if Elasticsearch was installed as a `deb/rpm` package on Linux, this path would be `file: /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/transport-couchbase/*`.
Note the trailing asterisk, which specifies that the policy applies to all files in the directory.

[.ui]*Edit with Policytool*

If using `policytool`, start it at the command line, specifying the policy file-location as follows:

----
$JAVA_HOME/bin/policytool -file $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.policy
----

When the applet-window appears, verify that the policy-file displayed in the upper editable text field is the one you intend to edit:

[#policyToolInitial]

== Couchbase Document Expiration

If the Couchbase _document expiration_ feature (whereby documents are set to expire after a specified period) is used on documents to be replicated to Elasticsearch, the corresponding feature must be enabled in the Elasticsearch mapping.
(The feature is disabled by default, since some cost is associated with its use.)

For details, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.0/mapping-ttl-field.html[_ttl field^], in the online Elasticsearch documentation.
