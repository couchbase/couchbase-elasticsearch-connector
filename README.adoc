The Couchbase Elasticsearch Connector replicates your documents from Couchbase Server to Elasticsearch in near real time.
The connector uses the high-performance Database Change Protocol (DCP) to receive notifications when documents change in Couchbase.

NOTE: If you're looking for the Elasticsearch Plug-in flavor of the connector, that's in a https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/tree/release/cypress[different branch].

== Building the connector from source

The connector distribution may be built from source with the command:

    ./gradlew build

The distribution archive will be generated under `build/distributions`.
During development, it might be more convenient to run:

    ./gradlew installDist

which creates `build/install/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector` as a `$CBES_HOME` directory.


=== Running the integration tests

A local Docker installation is required for these tests.
To quickly test using only the latest Couchbase and Elasticsearch:

    ./gradlew integrationTest


To test against _all_ supported versions of Couchbase and Elasticsearch:

    ./gradlew exhaustiveTest


=== IntelliJ IDEA setup
Because the project uses annotation processors, some link:INTELLIJ-SETUP.md[fiddly setup] is required when importing the project into IntelliJ IDEA.
