# Introduction to TOML config file format:

# The work of replicating a Couchbase bucket may be distributed between
# several connector worker processes, known collectively as a "group".
#
# The connector name uniquely identifies a group of connector workers.
# All workers in the group must use the same name. The group name
# is required even if there is only one worker.
#
# TIP: Changing the name invalidates the replication status checkpoint.
# To preserve the checkpoint, run the `cbes-checkpoint-backup` command
# before renaming, and `cbes-checkpoint-restore` afterwards.
[group]
  name = 'example-group'

# The simplest way to deploy the connector is "static" mode. In this mode,
# each worker process is independent of the others, and must be manually
# configured to know which partitions it is responsible for.
[group.static]
  # Each member in a static group must have a unique member number.
  memberNumber = 1 # A value from 1 to 'totalMembers', inclusive.

  # The total number of workers in the static group.
  #
  # TIP: To safely add or remove workers from a static group, first stop all
  # running workers, then reconfigure them with the new 'totalMembers' value,
  # and finally start all the workers again.

  # The Elasticsearch document may optionally contain Couchbase metadata

  # use an empty string.

#
# At a minimum, each type must specify a 'regex' (Java regular expression)
# or 'prefix' property. The type config matches any Couchbase document
# whose IDs matches the regex or prefix.
#
# The order of type definitions is significant. If a document ID matches
# more than one type, the assigned type will be the one that occurs first
# in this configuration. If none match, the document will not be indexed.

  # and "foo::bar::123" to index "foo".
  regex = '(?<index>.+?)::.*'

# In the travel-sample data model, a route is the child of an airline.
# Each route document has an `airlineid` field that holds the parent ID.

#   "index"  - (string) name of the index the connector tried to write to
#   "type"   - (string) document type name used for the write attempt
#   "action" - (string) failed action type ("INDEX" or "DELETE")
#   "error"  - (string) error message received from Elasticsearch
