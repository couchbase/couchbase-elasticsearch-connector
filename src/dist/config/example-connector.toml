# NOTE: Some properties in this file refer to filesystem paths.
# The base for a relative path is the connector installation directory.

# The work of replicating a Couchbase bucket may be distributed between
# several connector worker processes, known collectively as a "group".
#
# The connector name uniquely identifies a group of connector workers.
# All workers in the group must use the same name. The group name
# is required even if there is only one worker.
#
# TIP: Changing the name invalidates the replication status checkpoint.
# To preserve the checkpoint, run the `cbes-checkpoint-backup` command
# before renaming, and `cbes-checkpoint-restore` afterwards.
[group]

# The simplest way to deploy the connector is "static" mode. In this mode,
# each worker process is independent of the others, and must be manually
# configured to know which partitions it is responsible for.

# Each member in a static group must have a unique member number.
memberNumber = 1 # A value from 1 to 'totalMembers', inclusive.

# The total number of workers in the static group.
#
# TIP: To safely add or remove workers from a static group, first stop all
# running workers, then reconfigure them with the new 'totalMembers' value,
# and finally start all the workers again.
totalMembers = 1

[logging]

# instead of DEBUG. Enabling this feature lets you watch documents
# flow through the connector without having to edit the Log4j config file.
# Disabled by default because it generates many log messages.
